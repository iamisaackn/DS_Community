                <h2>1. Aviation Risk Assessment</h2>
                <p>
                    This project focuses on analyzing aviation risk to guide decision-making in the aviation industry. It addresses potential risks associated with various aircraft makes by cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board. The goal is to help businesses make informed choices on aircraft purchases based on accident frequencies, fatality distributions, and other critical factors. Key tools like Python, Tableau, and various data visualization libraries were used to generate actionable insights.

                <h2>2. Box Office Movies Analysis: EDA and Linear Regression Project</h2>
                <p>This project explores the film industry to help a new movie studio understand current box office trends and make informed production decisions. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and a Linear Regression Model, we investigate which movie genres are performing well and identify key factors driving box office success, including production budgets, release timing, and domestic vs. foreign gross. The project provides actionable recommendations for the studio's strategy based on data-driven insights.</p>

                <h2>3. Predictive Analytics for Waterpoint Operational Status in Tanzania</h2>
                <p>This project aims to predict the operational status of waterpoints in Tanzania by leveraging machine learning models. The goal is to enhance the maintenance and management of waterpoints, ensuring communities have reliable access to clean water. The project uses a comprehensive dataset that includes waterpoint characteristics, geographical data, and user quality levels to accurately classify waterpoints as functional, in need of repair, or non-functional.</p>
